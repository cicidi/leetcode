Dealing chanellenge is a requirement in workspace. The company mission/ direction can change due new customer requiement or new market. Also company may have funding. Whatever the reason, as a member of team, I would expect to do my share by absorbing the new information, analysising it thoroughly, share my ideas, and really be a valued team member.  Dealing with change is nessary trait. And the new oppotunity comes after change and chanllenge. I think I am also good at anticipte change by be attentive and observant.
For example, as it is known to public that wework revoke ipo last year, previous CEO step down, leadshiper replacement etc. New mission and strategy , which to improve the revnue and reduce the cost without expand business or investment. My team is in charge of build automation and occupancy senor. and we start a hackthon project, investing how to use cheap solution to detect occpancy. So we can apply oversale to wework space to more country. 

This project is still going on, but you might ask me why I am looking for other opputunity, that is a good question. Rising revenue is a chanllenge to company. But to me, I dont have person chanllege,  which is to keep my job to support family. If the company has 2nd layoff is sitll a question so I need another backup solution to this my chanllenge. This is how I handle my person chanllege and facing the change.
