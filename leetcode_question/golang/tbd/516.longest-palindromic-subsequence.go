 * Testcase Example:  '"bbbab"'
 *
 * 
 * Given a string s, find the longest palindromic subsequence's length in s.
 * You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: 
 * 
 * "bbbab"
 * 
 * Output: 
 * 
 * 4
 * 
 * One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bbbb".

 * Example 2:
 * Input:
 * 
 * "cbbd"
 * 
 * Output:
 * 
 * 2
 * 
 * One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bb".
