 * Hard (31.94%)
 * Total Accepted:    84.7K
 * Total Submissions: 262.1K
 * Testcase Example:  '["abcd","dcba","lls","s","sssll"]'
 *
 * Given a list of unique words, find all pairs of distinct indices (i, j) in
 * the given list, so that the concatenation of the two words, i.e. words[i] +
 * words[j] is a palindrome.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Input: ["abcd","dcba","lls","s","sssll"]
 * Output: [[0,1],[1,0],[3,2],[2,4]] 
 * Explanation: The palindromes are
 * ["dcbaabcd","abcddcba","slls","llssssll"]
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: ["bat","tab","cat"]
 * Output: [[0,1],[1,0]] 
 * Explanation: The palindromes are ["battab","tabbat"]
