 * Testcase Example:  '[3,9,20,15,7]'
 *
 * Given a non-empty binary tree, return the average value of the nodes on each
 * level in the form of an array.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input:
 * ⁠   3
 * ⁠  / \
 * ⁠ 9  20
 * ⁠   /  \
 * ⁠  15   7
 * Output: [3, 14.5, 11]
 * Explanation:
 * The average value of nodes on level 0 is 3,  on level 1 is 14.5, and on
 * level 2 is 11. Hence return [3, 14.5, 11].
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * The range of node's value is in the range of 32-bit signed integer.
